<a target="_blank" href="https://www.renesas.com/qcstudio">Quick-Connect Studio</a> is a cloud-based design platform allowing users to visually create software prototypes for rapid validation and product development. Engineers can drag and drop hardware device blocks to build solutions, and the platform auto-generates software for no-code development. QuickConnect boards with standard connections are then available for users to deploy the auto-generated software to test within a matter of minutes.
