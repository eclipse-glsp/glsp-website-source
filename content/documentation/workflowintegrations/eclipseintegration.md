The GLSP Eclipse IDE allows to use GLSP-based diagrams within the Eclipse Desktop IDE. This is accomplished by integrating a Chrome-based browser seemlessly as a regular Eclipse editor part.
The example GLSP Eclipse IDE client is hosted in the [GLSP Eclipse integration repository](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-eclipse-integration). You will find [detailed information on how to launch it and how to get the sources in the wiki](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-eclipse-integration#workflow-diagram-example).
