GLSP does not require the usage of any IDE. GLSP diagrams can be embedded into any existing web application or even be deployed standalone. The workflow example also provides a standalone client, which shows the diagram as a plain web application.
The example GLSP standalone client is hosted in the [GLSP client repository](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client). You will find [detailed information on how to launch it and how to get the sources in the wiki](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client#workflow-diagram-example).
