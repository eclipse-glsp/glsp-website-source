The purpose of [the GLSP minimal diagram example](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-examples), as the name implies, is to provide a minimal feature set and therefore is very easy to understand. Thus, it is a perfect starting point for your GLSP-based project. The example supports exactly one node type, which is rendered as a rectangle. Nevertheless, it still demonstrates a lot of powerful generic GLSP features such as add, delete, undo/redo, resizing, zooming, etc. The minimal example is embedded into [Eclipse Theia](https://eclipsesource.com/technology/eclipse-theia/) too.
