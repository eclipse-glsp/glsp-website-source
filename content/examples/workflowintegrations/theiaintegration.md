The GLSP Theia integration allows to use GLSP-based diagrams within the [Eclipse Theia IDE](https://eclipsesource.com/technology/eclipse-theia/). The example integrates the diagrams with IDE features such as opening files, the problems view and the main menues. It can be deployed/used online in a browser or as a desktop application (via electron).
The example GLSP Theia client is hosted in the [GLSP Theia integration repository](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-theia-integration). You will find [detailed information on how to launch it and how to get the sources in the wiki](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-theia-integration#workflow-diagram-example).
