The GLSP VS Code integration allows to use GLSP-based diagrams within VS Code. See the GLSP wiki for a feature comparison of the different integrations (e.g. Theia compared to VS Code).
The example GLSP VS Code client is hosted in the [GLSP VS Code integration repository](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-vscode-integration). You will find [detailed information on how to launch it and how to get the sources in the wiki](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-vscode-integration#workflow-diagram-example).
