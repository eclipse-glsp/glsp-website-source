The purpose of [the GLSP minimal diagram example](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-examples) is to simple starting point with a minimal feature set. Thus, it is a perfect starting point for your GLSP-based project. The example supports exactly one node type, which is rendered as a rectangle, but it still demonstrates a lot of powerful generic GLSP features. The minimal example is embedded into [Eclipse Theia](https://eclipsesource.com/technology/eclipse-theia/) too.
