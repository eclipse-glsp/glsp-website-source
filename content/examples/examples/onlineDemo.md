The simplest way to try a GLSP-based diagram editor is to start our online demonstrator. It demonstrates GLSP embedded into an example tool based on [Eclipse Theia](https://eclipsesource.com/technology/eclipse-theia). [Start the demo](https://eclipsesource.com/coffee-editor) and click on "Diagram Editor" to the right. See also the next example for details about the tool (coffee editor).
