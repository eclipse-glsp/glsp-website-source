The purpose of the [project templates]({{< relref "documentation/gettingstarted" >}}) is to provide a simple starting point for your GLSP-based project, whether you are want to integrate your editor with [Eclipse Theia](https://eclipsesource.com/technology/eclipse-theia/) or [VS Code](https://eclipsesource.com/technology/vs-code/), or plan to use a node-based or Java-based server, use EMF or JSON; the project templates have you covered.
