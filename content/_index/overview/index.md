GLSP is an extensible open source framework to build custom diagram editors in the web/cloud. Those editors can be deployed stand-alone or integrated into a web-based IDE such as Eclipse Theia or VS Code. GLSP defines a language server protocol (LSP) for diagrams and integrates well with your existing tool chain and business logic.
