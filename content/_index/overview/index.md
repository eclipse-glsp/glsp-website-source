The Graphical Language Server Platform (GLSP) is an extensible open-source framework for building custom diagram editors based on web technologies.
Alongside an extensible client and server framework (node or Java), GLSP provides a language server protocol (LSP) for diagrams.
With that, GLSP enables the development of modern, web-based diagram editors, whereas the heavy lifting, such as loading, interpreting, and editing according to the rules of the modeling language, is encapsulated in the server.
