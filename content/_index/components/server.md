Enabled by the flexible protocol-based architecture, a domain-specific GLSP server can be implemented in any preferred technology.
Therefore, you can easily integrate a GLSP server into an existing environment and even reuse existing domain-specific business logic.
GLSP provides a framework for the implementation of GLSP servers using Java or Node, as well as an optional integration with EMF.
