GLSP enables a clear separation between diagram client and server which communicates using the defined protocol.
This flexible approach provides a clear encapsulation of your domain-specific diagram logic on the server from the rendering part on the client.
The diagram client is highly customizable and extensible to add custom shapes or editing features.
Also the protocol can be extended with custom messages, if needed.
