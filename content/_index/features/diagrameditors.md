GLSP provides the perfect basis for the efficient development of web-based diagram editors including edit functionality, layouting, shapes, palettes and everything else you expect from a powerful, modern diagram editor.
GLSP doesn't hide the underlying rendering technologies, such as Eclipse Sprotty, SVG, and CSS.
Thus, you have the full power of those technologies at your fingertips to implement scalable and interactive diagrams that are styleable with CSS.
